                            <p>Kutumba is an Entitlement Management System which is being developed into an Integrated Social Information System (SIIS) which consists of a social registry, integrated beneficiary management systems, beneficiary registry, payment platform and a grievance redressal system. The project aims to achieve suo-moto delivery of benefits and services by checking entitlement, identifying eligible residents and thereafter sanction/approve the service or scheme.  </p>
                            <p>Kutumba uses the data as available in various department databases. Kutumba ID will enable residents to check their entitlement and eligibility and apply for schemes.
